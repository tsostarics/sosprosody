# sosprosody

This package includes a variety of helper functions involving praat, textgrids,
pitchtiers, and intonation-related data wrangling.
This has been written for my own research, but others may find it helpful as
well.
This package extends the `rPraat` package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sosprosody like so:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('tsostarics/sosprosody)
```

example coming soon
