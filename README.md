# sosprosody

This package includes a variety of helper functions involving praat,
textgrids, pitchtiers, and intonation-related data wrangling. This has
been written for my own research, but others may find it helpful as
well. This package extends the `rPraat` package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sosprosody like so:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('tsostarics/sosprosody)
```

example coming soon
